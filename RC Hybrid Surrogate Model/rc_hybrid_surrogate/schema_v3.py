"""Reader for the hybrid_gnn_lstm_v3 sample contract.

The v2 pipeline predicted one roof-displacement trace from a pooled graph
embedding, so it only ever read six arrays. v3 exports the full structural
response -- per-floor kinematics, per-element forces, per-hinge rotations,
per-joint forces -- which is what the per-node and per-element decoders need.

Two things about v3 drive the design here.

Sampling rate is not uniform. Floor kinematics, story drift and base shear are
recorded every step; element forces, joint forces and hinge rotations are
recorded every NTHA_ELEMENT_HISTORY_STRIDE (8) steps. The strided arrays ship
with an explicit index array (element_force_steps, hinge_rotation_steps)
giving the exact step each row was taken at, so a decoder running at full rate
can be supervised on the strided quantities by gathering those indices. No
resampling or assumed alignment is required, and none should be introduced.

Node and element counts vary per sample. Every per-node and per-element array
is therefore ragged across a batch and has to be concatenated with an index
vector, the way torch_geometric batches node features, rather than stacked.
