"""Capacity design at every joint: probable strengths, shear, joint shear, anchorage.

Pure computation on an explicit ``state`` dictionary (no OpenSees, no
Structure_Parameters); the driver assembles the state and applies the
selected transverse steel. Everything here is ACI 318-19 Chapter 18:

* Beam probable moment Mpr (18.6.5.1): the developed beam-plus-slab section
  of SMRF_Beam_Slab_Strength with steel at 1.25 fy and phi = 1.
* Beam design shear Ve: Mpr equilibrium over the clear span plus the
  factored gravity face reactions from the slab transfer (SMRF_Joints
  .beam_capacity_shear_envelope), for the high- and low-gravity seismic
  combinations. Vc = 0 in the hinge zone when the mechanism shear is at least
  half of Ve and the axial load is below Ag fc/20 (18.6.5.2); Vs limited to
  8 sqrt(fc) bw d (22.5.1.2). Hoop spacing/legs/bar are chosen from Ve, the
  18.6.4.4 spacing bounds and a 1-in grid from 3 in.
* Column design shear Ve (18.7.6.1.1), by a selectable, named method
  (``state["column_shear_method"]``, COLUMN_SHEAR_METHODS):
  - ``beam_joint_delivery_limited_v2`` (the default, the method every
    saved design was produced with): 2 Mpr,col / ln from the column's own
    probable P-M strength over its factored axial range, not exceeding the
    shear the beams' probable strengths can deliver through the joints
    (floor joints split the beam moments equally above/below; a roof joint
    sends all of it into the single column), never below the analysis
    shear.
  - ``column_own_probable_envelope_v3`` (2026-09-20, the engineering
    note's candidate): the column's own probable end moments over the
    factored axial range of each end, in each bending sense, summed for
    the governing sway and divided by the clear height, never below the
    analysis shear in that direction; no beam-sharing reduction. The
    probable moment over an axial range is the exact section solution at
    the maximizing load, located on the curve's vertices rather than on a
    sparse sample (probable_moment_over_axial_range).
  Both values are recorded for every story and direction whatever the
  method; the method only selects Ve. Vc per 18.7.6.2.1 / 22.5.5.1, hoops
  from Vs, the 18.7.5.4 confinement area and the 18.7.5.3 spacing limits
  (so from hx with every face bar tied).
* Joint shear (18.8.4): Vj = T + C - Vcol with T = 1.25 fy As including the
  slab bars in the effective flange, Vcol from the same mechanism, Aj per
  15.4.2.4 (SMRF_Joints.rectangular_joint_area), gamma per Table 18.8.4.3
  from its three inputs -- the column continuous or meeting 15.2.6, the beam
  in the direction of Vj continuous or meeting 15.2.7, confinement by two
  transverse beams per 15.2.8 (each at least 3/4 of the face it frames
  into, extending at least h beyond the joint, with two continuous top and
  bottom bars and No. 3 or larger stirrups) -- each resting on declared
  evidence, unknown evidence leaving the conservative row; phi = 0.85.
* Terminating beam bars (18.8.5.1): standard 90-degree hooks, ldh =
  fy db / (65 lambda sqrt(fc)) >= max(8 db, 6 in) inside the column depth
  less cover and hoop; through bars keep the 18.8.2.3 depth check.

Steel and concrete units: kip, inch, ksi (sqrt(fc) terms use psi).
