"""Pure, explicitly scoped SMRF load-combination and drift evidence helpers.

Units are kip and inch; no OpenSees imports or model state are used here. These
helpers do not establish ELF eligibility or complete building-code compliance.
ASCE/SEI 7-22 Chapters 2 and 12 are the declared basis. Primary references:
https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/codes-and-standards/asce-sei-7-22
https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/gcr/2016/NIST.GCR.16-917-40.pdf

The NIST guide explains the approach but predates ASCE 7-22. In particular,
7-22 permits a 0.10 lower bound on theta_max and limits beta >= 1.25/Omega0;
these newer details must not be taken from an older worked example.

Edition discipline (2026-09-18): every rule here names the edition it comes
from. ASCE 7-22 12.6 lists the ELF procedure of 12.8 as permitted for any
structure; the 7-16 Table 12.6-1 height/period/irregularity restriction was
deleted (NCSEA, Design Guide for Structural Irregularities, "Permitted
Analytical Procedures", p. 4; S. K. Ghosh, Significant Changes in ASCE 7-22,
SEAU 2024, slide 116). Torsional irregularity is 7-22 Table 12.3-1 Type 1
from the torsional irregularity ratio of 12.3.2.1.1 (TIR > 1.2, a ratio of
story drifts) or the 75% one-sided strength criterion; the former Type 1b is
Type 1 with TIR > 1.4 (Ghosh slides 101-105). The 7-16 12.3.3.1
prohibition of extreme torsional irregularity in SDC E/F was REMOVED in
7-22 (FEMA P-2192 Vol. 1 sec. 1.4.5; California 2025 Title 24 change record
for 1617.12.6 / 1617A.1.10: "Repealed all language related to the extreme
torsional irregularities. Revised to align with ASCE 7-22"), so the
population's TIR <= 1.4 ceiling is project policy in every SDC. The 12.8.4.3
amplification Ax is a ratio of level displacements, computed per level with
Ax = 1, and is kept separate from the TIR.
